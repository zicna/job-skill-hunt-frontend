# <center> Job and Skill Hunt App</center>


The idea for building this application is to use knowledge in rails and react to building a full-stack app to serve to help Bootcamp grads software developers in organizing their time and goals between job searching and learning new skills, new languages, and data structures , algorithmic problems and skills needed to pass HR interview. 

The second goal of building applications is to revisit, strengthen and expand my knowledge in areas I feel would benefit my career as a software developer.

Here at the beginning is a list of things I would like to include in this application:
## Backend
- [ ] postgreSQL database
- [ ] join tables
- [ ] use faker gem for seed.rb file
- [ ] backend data manipulation
- [ ] model level validations
- [ ] custom model level validations
- [ ] JWT and device for authoritazion and authentication

## Frontend

- [ ] predominantly usage of react functional components
- [ ] Avoid prop drilling
- [ ] ReactRouter
- [ ] use propTypes and default props
- [ ] Async react (fetch / axios)

___
## Daily assignments

1. Day One 
   - initial commands for backend and frontend
   - setup separate githun repos
   - initial readme.md file
   - DB schema chart (with all attributes needed for JWT and devise)
   - add DB schema picture to readme.md

   Notes: 
   - instal latest version of Node and npx create-react-app
   - if it's still not working run `npx clear npx cache`
   - 

2. Day Two
   - generate models
   - generate routes
   - generate seed data 
   - basic model validations
   - generate controllers

## Testing 
*Any testing in this application will require to learn or expand (I know some of RSpec testing in rails) testing libraries*

**Backend**
- [ ] model, controller and route testing with RSpec
  
**Frontend**
- [ ] this will require to learn new library for testing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
